<h1>Readme Application Framework</h1>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The main motivation to create the framework was to support clean software. The following list shows a new idea to achieve better code quality. * Work in small teams. One precondition is, that the tasks are small and concise. * Keep the number of dependencies as low as possible.<br/>* Find ways to minimize degradation of inner quality of a system while working on it. </p>
<p>Surely there are many other circumstances which should be noted. Let's have a simple example. </p>
<p><code>java
Money price calculatePrice(Article article);
</code> This is a rather simple signature. It is required, because articles may depend on daily purchase prices. Therefore there should be some functionality to calculate the price. </p>
<p>Some time later, you may want to excite your employees and support the commitment to your shop. Thus you provide the personal the possibility to purchase your goods to reduced prices. This requirement changes the signature to:</p>
<p><code>java
Money price calculatePrice(Article article, Employee employee);
</code> Next the marketing department wants to create some buying incentives for the customers. They are going to introduce vouchers which can be given to customers. The requirement changes the signature to:</p>
<p><code>java
Money price calculatePrice(Article article, Employee employee, Voucher voucher);
</code> You can imagine that there will come further request which will again raise the need to extend the price calculation functionality. </p>
<p>If we have a closer look what is going to happen inside the price calculation and later cash up at checkout. At the moment we provide advantages to employees, we have to consider the taxes. The employee receives an additional income which requires taxes to be paid. This means at the moment the employee checks out the goods, the human resources management need to know the purchase. Also there is a need to book the difference, because if the product is sold below its price, the difference needs to be considered in accounting. </p>
<p>This look opens the eyes, the simple procedure calculatePrice consists of various different data flows which are interwoven and not reflected by the programming flow. So the simple example of calculatePrice shows several risks: * high complexity * numerous dependencies * danger of improper use of information, because all is available by the signature * I'm sure, I could find several further problems if I go deeper</p>
<p>What the heck if I could stay at the simple call of the first implementation. All would be fine. * small and clear task * minimum of dependencies * no improper use of other internal information * no danger of wrong dependencies * clear responsibilities</p>
<p>So the idea is, to divide the task in several components: * BasePriceCalculator which does the original job * EmployeeDiscountCalculator which calculates the discount for the employee and is responsible for all the taxes stuff. This component is owned by the human resources department. * VoucherDiscountCalculator which calculates the discount based on a voucher the customer provides. This component is owned by the marketing. </p>
<p>At next we need a small component which combines the different calculators. The idea of the framework is, that all the calculators are provided as independent components by the responsible business department. Than there is one component of the framework, which binds them together. To make this happen, it is necessary to slightly change the signature of the original call. Since we want to transport more information, I created the so called ApplicationProtocoll. It allows for various appendixes (ApplicationAppendix) which can provide information to the calculating beans. Since there are also many result values, the protocol collects them together. This leads to a calculation pipeline. </p>
<p>An Appendix is owned by a business organization, e.g. the marketing. Each appendix owned by marketing carries the id of marketing. So the appendixes marketing is responsible can easily identified. Applying this changes, the signature would like this:</p>
<p><code>java
@Emulated
interface PriceCalculator {
	@Implementation(
			implementations = {
					BasePriceCalculator.class,
					EmployeeDiscountCalculator.class,
					VoucherDiscountCalculator.class
			})
    ApplicationProtocol&lt;Money&gt; price calculatePrice(Article article, ApplicationProtocol&lt;Money&gt; state);
}
</code>  The application protocol is input to receive private information and it is output, to be able to forward all information inclusive appendixes of  different responsibilities. The annotation @Emulated tells the system, that it has to do some magic with this interface. The annotation @Implementation tells the magic behind the scene which beans which should be used. </p>
<p>The signature of the BasePriceCalculator could be like this:</p>
<p>```java public class BasePriceCalculator {</p>
<pre><code>@CallStrategy(strategy = CallingStrategy.Eager)
public ApplicationProtocol&lt;BigDecimal&gt; calculatePrice(
       @Required final Article article,
       @Required final ApplicationProtocol&lt;BigDecimal&gt; state) {

    // do the task

    return protocol;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>``` In this example the BasePriceCalculator is a POJ. Instead also a Spring bean can be used, if the interface of the bean is used at the introduction of the PriceCalculator. Here you find other annotations. The @CallStrategy tells, whether this bean is called conditionally or in every case (Eager). The information @Required at the method parameters, tell, that the call is only possible if the required information is present. </p>
<p>Lets have a look at the next bean, the EmployeeDiscountCalculator:</p>
<p>```java public class EmployeeDiscountCalculator {</p>
<pre><code>@CallStrategy(strategy = CallingStrategy.RequiredParameters)
public ApplicationProtocol&lt;BigDecimal&gt; calculatePrice(
       @Required final Article article,
       @Required final Employee employee,
       @Required final ApplicationProtocol&lt;BigDecimal&gt; state) {

    // do the task

    return protocol;
}
</code></pre>
<p>} ``` The difference is, that the strategy now is RequiredParameters. Thus the call will only happen, if the employee can be found within the appendix. Remember the interface PriceCalculator. This bean requires the at the method signature of calculatePrice the additional parameter employee. It is annotated as required. In this case the system extracts the employee from the appendix, since there is no employee available within the signature of the emulated interface. If the employee is not found in the appendix, the bean will not be called. </p>
<p>Another aspect of this procedure is, that the calculation result can easily archived, because it is available as a complex object (the protocol). Staying with the example above, the procedure could be: - Customer informs about possible price for an article. - Later on at check out the customer wants to purchase the article. </p>
<p>Normally one would repeat the whole calculation which could be require extensive resources. By using a cache it would be possible to reuse the first calculation and save resources. </p>
<h2>The Programming Example</h2>
<p>The source code is divided into two parts. The package de.adesso.example.application contains the example application. Let's have a look in the application configuration, found in class ApplicationConfig. It creates the bean "priceCalculator". This construction provides a view of the tasks the framework has to accomplish, if running annotation based. There is a interface PriceCalculator which has to define at least one call. The interface is not implemented in the application. The implementation is generated by the calls found in the configuration. In this case, the configuration is the only part of the program which references the various calculators. At best, all calculator should be in each case part of an own project. In this case, no calculator would be able to implement wrong dependencies. </p>
<p>There is an additional interface, PriceCalculatorAnnotated. It provides the same functionality only by using annotations. The preconditions to make it work are the following: - The interface is annotated with @Emulated. There is no implementation available for that interface. - Methods which should be emulated are annotated with @Implementation. This annotation lists the beans which should be incorporated into the implementation which is generated. - Parameters of the emulated interface annotated with @RequiredParameter are mandatory and may not be null. - Each implementing bean is required to provide a method with the same identifier as within the interface. Overloaded methods are not supported. - The methods of the implementing beans may be annotated with an annotation @CallStrategy. It provides a clue how to handle the call. If the strategy is EAGER, the method has to be called in any way. If the strategy is RequiredParameters, the method is only called if the required parameters are available. Parameter which are required are marked with the annotation @Required. If one parameter has to be extract from the appendix and is not present, no call will happen. </p>
<p>You can surf through the client application. It creates the example introduced at the beginning of this documentation. </p>
<h2>The Implementation</h2>
<p>The central class of the implementation is the DaisyChainDispatcher. It is the InvocationHandler of the generated proxy. The class DaisyChainDispatcherFactory is the class to be used to provide instances of the dispatcher. The first example of the manual construction of the PriceCalculator interface used the DaisyChainDispatcherFactory explicitly. </p>
<p>The other solution with the annotated interface PriceCalculatorAnnotated the class ApplicationBeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor is the game changer. It is a BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor which scans the classes and looks for the @Emulated annotation. It does the job to prepare the interfaces. The bean factories to create the emulation is implemented in the class ApplicationProxyFactory which is entered into the bean registry as factory for the interfaces. Spring then uses this factory to create the emulated interfaces. It was a little bit tricky to get the implementation running, because a lot of knowledge about internal information of Spring was necessary. </p>
<p>MethodImplementation is the helper class which represents an emulated method of the emulated interface. BeanOperation is the representation of a call to a bean implementing the emulated method. Arguments are the representation of parameters. There is a lot of checking during construction of the emulation. Later on the state represents how to extract the parameters. </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The system introduces new Annotations to be used. Dependencies between business departments cooperating to implement price calculation are removed. By this the development team should have an easier task to keep the system tidy. </p>
<p>This is a proposal. It is the first draft of an idea. It can grow to useful tool if many ideas can be incorporated. Please don't hesitate, I appreciate any comment on it, even if you don't like it. </p>
<p>There are still ideas which are not implemented yet.</p>
<h3>Further dispatchers</h3>
<p>At the moment there is only a DaisyChainDispatcher which provides calculations like pipelines. The only extension to pipelines is, that calculations within the pipe can be made optional. </p>
<p>Another dispatcher idea could be a splitting and a joining dispatcher. For example if your business task is to provide offers from various suppliers, than you might collect offers in parallel to minimize the elapsed time during calculation. The procedure could be, select the suppliers, prepare the requests and then split the calculation. Each request itself could be processed again as a daisy chain. Later on, the join collects all results in a common format. </p>
<h3>Distinction</h3>
<p>This idea is in competition with other possibilities to implement this problem. At first I want to note BPMN driven engines. The process is designed with help of a standardized notation, which can be processed by various different engines. Chaining of tasks, split and join are already available. </p>
<p>The BPMN engine introduces a lot of new infrastructure. If your shop already works with BPMN, that's fine and a very good choice. In this case this framework could probably support implementation of tasks of a fine grained level. But it will never replace the BPMN solution.</p>
